## Install `webpack`

Install `webpack`, `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware`
```
$ yarn add webpack webpack-dev-middleware webpack-hot-middleware --dev
```

## Install `webpack` plugins

`HardSourceWebpackPlugin` is a plugin for webpack to provide an intermediate caching step for modules. In order to see results, you'll need to run webpack twice with this plugin: the first build will take the normal amount of time. The second build will be signficantly faster.

The `html-webpack-plugin` plugins, is a webpack plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. 

```
$ yarn add html-webpack-plugin hard-source-webpack-plugin --dev
```

Install Babel
```
$ yarn add @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/polyfill @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-eslint babel-loader --dev
```

Install React

You have to install `react` at this point, otherwise the `react-hot-loader` plugin doesn't work. 
```
$ yarn add react
```

Now configure babel
```
$ code packages.json
```
...by adding this conde snippet to `packages.json`
```json
  "babel": {
    "env": {
      "development": {
        "presets": [
          "@babel/preset-env",
          "@babel/preset-react"
        ],
        "plugins": [
          "react-hot-loader/babel"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

Setup directory-structure
```
$ mkdir -p src/actions src/components src/constants src/reducers src/store src/styles src/types src/utils tools
```

## Getting started with simple `index.js` file

Create a simple `index.js` file that logs something to the console
```
$ echo 'console.log("Hi there");' > src/index.js
```

## Create webserver script

```
$ mkdir tools
$ touch tools/srcServer.js
```

The server uses a few more dev dependencies
```
$ yarn add browser-sync @babel/node react-hot-loader --dev
```

## Start the webserver

```
$ yarn start
```
