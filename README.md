# Simple React Project template

I've created this repository step-by-step, by following the Pluralsight course [Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6/table-of-contents) from Cory House. Highly recommended course IMHO.

Instead of simply using his outdated [pluralsight-redux-start repository](https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter), I've used his [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) repository for inspiration. 

__In my [step by step](STEP-BY-STEP.md) guide, I try to explain what I am doing to get this super basic setup working__


## Why my own `simple-react-project-template`

I know there are many `react` starterkits out ther on Github. But since I am (not yet) an experienced frontend developer, I would like to understand what it is that I am installing and why. Therefore I've created my own simple starterkit. 

## Should I use this for production?

No I don't advise you to use this project for production. This project can however be very helpfull in understanding what all the Node modules are being used for. Just follow my commit-trail and read the [step by step](STEP-BY-STEP.md) guide to start learning.
