# Simple React Project template

I've created this repository step-by-step, by following the Pluralsight course Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6 from Cory House.

Instead of simply using his outdated [pluralsight-redux-start repository](https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter), I've used his [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) repository for inspiration. 

In my [step by step](STEP-BY-STEP.md) guide, I try to explain what I am doing to get this super basic setup working
